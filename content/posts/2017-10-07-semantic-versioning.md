## Format
    vX.Y.Z


- X = Major Version
  When you do make big changes to the software or APIs. Also when you break existing APIs or doing some refactoring.
- Y = Minor Version
  When you do add some features/functionalities thatâ€™s ready for release in dev testing(e.g each sprint). For example every sprint done with the features will increment the Y.
- Z = Patches/Bugs Fixes/Issues Fixes
  When you do some bugs fixing, issues fixing or adding some patch.


## Workflow

Use Git feature called `tag` which will tag commit that is ready for incrementing the version number.
**Tag Current Commit**
*unannotated:*

    git tag vX.Y.Z

*annotated:*

    git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "tag message"

**Tag Previous Commit**
*unannotated:*

    git tag vX.Y.Z <commit_id>

*annotated:*

    git tag -a vX.Y.Z <commit_id> -m "tag message"
